如今，从事体力劳动的人的收入一般要比坐办公室的人高出许多。
坐办公室的人之所以常常被称作“白领工人”，就是因为他们通常是穿着硬领白衬衫、系着领带去上班。
许多人常常情愿放弃较高的薪水以换取做白领工人的殊荣，此乃人之常情。
而这常常会引起种种奇怪的现象，在Ellesmere公司当清洁工的Alfred·Bloggs就是一个例子。

These days, people who do manual work often receive far more money than people who work in offices.
People who work in offices are frequently referred to as 'white-collar workers' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work.
Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers.
This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.

Alf结婚时，感到非常难为情，而没有将自己的职业告诉妻子。
他只说在Ellesmere公司上班。
每天早晨，他穿上一身漂亮的黑色西装离家上班，然后换上工作服，当8个小时清洁工。
晚上回家前，他洗个淋浴，重新换上那身黑色西服。
两年多以来，Alf一直这样，他的同事也为他保守秘密。

When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job.
He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation.
Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit.
He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman.
Before returning home at night, he took a shower and changed back into his suit.
Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret.


Alf的妻子一直不知道她嫁给了一个清洁工，而且她永远也不会知道了，因为Alf已找到新职，不久就要坐在办公室里办公了。
他将来挣的钱只有他现在的一半。不过他觉得，地位升高了，损失点儿钱也值得。
从此，他可以一天到晚穿西服了。
别人将称呼他为“Bloggs先生”，而不再叫他“Alf”了。

Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job.
He will soon be working in an office.
He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money.
From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr. Bloggs', not 'Alf'.
