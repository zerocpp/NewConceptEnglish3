不久之前，在爱琴海的基亚岛上，考古工作者有一项有趣的发现。
Some time ago, an interesting discovery was made by archeologists on the Aegean island of Kea.
一个美国考古队在阿伊亚.依里尼海角的一座古城里考察了一座庙宇。
An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini.
这座古城肯定一度很繁荣，因为它曾享有高度的文明。
The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization.
房子一般有3层楼高，用石块修建。里面房间很大，墙壁装饰华丽。
Houses -- often three stories high -- were built of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls.
城里甚至还敷设了排水系统，因为在狭窄的街道底下发现了许许多多陶土制作的排水管道。
The city was even equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.

考古工作者考察的这座庙宇从公元前15世纪直到罗马时代一直是祭祀祈祷的场所。
The temple which the archeologists explored was used as a place of worship from the fifteenth century B.C. until Roman times.
在庙中最神圣的一间殿堂里发现了15尊陶雕像的碎片。
In the most sacred room of the temple, clay fragments of fifteen statues were found.
每一尊雕像代表一位女神，而且一度上过色。
Each of these represented a goddess and had, at one time, been painted.
其中有一尊雕像，她的躯体是在公元前15世纪的历史文物中发现的。
The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the fifteenth century B.C.
而她那身异处的脑袋却碰巧是在公元前5世纪的文物中找到的。
Its missing head happened to be among remains of the fifth century B.C.
她的脑袋一定是在古希腊罗马时代就为人所发现，并受到精心的保护。
This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved.
即使在当时，它也属历史悠久的珍奇之物。
It was very old and precious even then.
考古工作者把这些碎片重新拼装起来后，惊奇地发现那位女神原来是一位相貌十分摩登的女郎。
When the archeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find that the goddess turned out to be a very modern-looking woman.
她身高3英尺，双手叉腰。
She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips.
她身穿一条拖地长裙
She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground.
尽管上了年纪，但体态确实优美。不过，考古工作者至今未能确定这位女神的身份。
Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archeologists have been unable to discover her identity.
